I went to Hakone(one of the most famous hot-spring resort) begining Feb.
I visited some populer siteseeing sopts. sach as  old temple, Lake Ashinoko, Oowakudani.


## Oowakudani
It takes an hour from Hakoneyumoto station to Oowakudani by train, cablecar and ropeway.
Hakone is active volcano, so that we can see a lot of steam and hot spring at Oowakudani.
This hotsprings have a lot of sulfur. So smell like rotten eggs.

The "black eggs", the specialty of Owakudani, are boiled in sulfur spring,  
so they taste little bit solty.
There is "black eggs"  myth. If you eat a black egg, your life extends 7 more years.

## Eva
Hakone filled with "Evangelion".
Because the captal japan called 3rd tokyo city is located in Hakone Evangelion story.


Hakone city collabolate with Evangelion to promote their city.
So there are a bunch of promotional good and places, such as eva rice cake, train ticket vendering machine and offical eva store(always clouded).
